To create a new tutorial folder:

    Open Documentation-Theme/_data/sidebars/tutorial_sidebar.yml
    Type the following: (the vertical bars represent the left of the file)
        |  - title: FolderTitle
        |    output: web
        |    folderitems:
    where FolderTitle is a title of your choosing.

To create a new tutorial page:

    Open Documentation-Theme/_data/sidebars/tutorial_sidebar.yml
    Find the tutorial folder it you want to put the tutorial in.
    Starting on the line underneath "folderitems:" insert the following: (the vertical bars represent the left of the file)

        |    - title: TutorialTitle
        |      url: someURL
        |      output: web

    where TutorialTitle is a title for your tutorial that will appear in the sidebar, and someURL is the in-browser
    url of your new tutorial page. For example, someURL for the "Conditionals" tutorial in the "Variables" folder
    might be /variables/conditionals/.

    Now go to Documentation-Theme/tutorial/ and create a markdown file for your new tutorial.
    The header of the markdown file should be: (the vertical bars represent the left of the file)

        |---
        |title: TutorialTitle
        |keywords: tutorialKeywords
        |summary: Description
        |sidebar: tutorial_sidebar
        |permalink: someURL
        |folder: tutorial
        |---

    where TutorialTitle is the title that will appear on the top of your page, tutorialKeywords is a list of key
    words in the tutorial, separated by commas, and someURL is the same as the previous someURL.

    The last line of your markdown file should be the following: (the vertical bars represent the left of the file)

        |<object id="example-1" data="{{site.editor}}?graceFile" width="100%" height="550px"> </object>

    where graceFile is the name of the grace file that corresponds to this tutorial (without the .grace extension).

    Finally, create a corresponding grace program for the embedded web editor and save it into the embedded-web-editor git
    repository under examples/

To change the site's base URL

    Edit _config.yml's url and baseurl values (located near the top) to contain the site's desired location.
    Similarly, to specify the embedded web editor's location, edit _config.yml's editor value.
